#summary Setting up Mylyn to use this issue tracker

= Update Mylyn =

Make sure you have Mylyn 3.0.1 or later.  You can add the update sites if necessary:

from http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/downloads/

  * http://download.eclipse.org/tools/mylyn/update/e3.4
  * http://download.eclipse.org/tools/mylyn/update/incubator

Install the *Web Templates (Generic Web Connector)* plugin so Eclipse can scrape the code.google.com website interface for you.

= Configure Mylyn =

You can follow the instructions [http://www.jroller.com/alexRuiz/entry/using_mylyn_with_google_code on Alex Ruiz's weblog] to configure Mylyn.  This is basically what I did:

  * Window->Show View->Mylyn->Task Repositories
  * Add Task Repository
  * Web Template (Advanced)

  * In "Server" field select *Eclipse Outliner (Google Code)*
  * Change "Server" to http://code.google.com/p/egit/issues
  * Change "Label" to EGit
  * Keep "Anonymous Access"

  * Expand the "Advanced Configuration" section.
  * Change "Query Request URL" to
{{{
${serverUrl}/csv?can=1&colspec=ID+Status+Type+Owner+Summary
}}}
  * Change "Query Pattern" to
{{{
"({Id}[0-9]+?)","({Status}.+?)","({Type}.+?)","({Owner}.+?)","({Description}.+?)"\n
}}}
